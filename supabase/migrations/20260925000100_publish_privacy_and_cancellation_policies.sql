  <p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0</p>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 2026</p>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 2026</p>
  <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
  <p>At Opulence Bliss Ltd, we understand that plans can change.</p>
  <p>This Cancellation &amp; Refund Policy explains what happens when a customer needs to cancel or change a cleaning booking, when a cleaner is unable to attend, and when a refund may be available.</p>
  <p>Our aim is to operate a policy that is fair to customers and fair to our self-employed cleaning professionals.</p>
  <p>This policy should be read together with our Customer Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>
  <h2>2. Booking Cancellation</h2>
  <p>A customer may request cancellation of a booking by contacting Opulence Bliss Ltd as soon as possible.</p>
  <p>Cancellation requests can be made by:</p>
  <p>WhatsApp;</p>
  <p>Telephone;</p>
  <p>SMS; or</p>
  <p>Email.</p>
  <p>A cancellation is only considered received once Opulence Bliss Ltd has received the customer's notification.</p>
  <p>Customers should provide:</p>
  <p>Name;</p>
  <p>Booking date;</p>
  <p>Property address; and</p>
  <p>Any other information needed to identify the booking.</p>
  <h2>3. Cancellation Notice Period</h2>
  <p>The applicable cancellation charge depends on how much notice is provided.</p>
  <p>More than 48 hours before the booking</p>
  <p>Where a customer cancels more than 48 hours before the scheduled cleaning appointment, no cancellation charge will normally apply.</p>
  <p>Where payment has already been received, the customer will normally be entitled to a refund, subject to any lawful deductions that may apply.</p>
  <p>Between 24 and 48 hours before the booking</p>
  <p>Where a customer cancels between 24 and 48 hours before the scheduled appointment, Opulence Bliss may apply a cancellation charge of up to 25% of the booking price.</p>
  <p>Any remaining balance will be refunded where applicable.</p>
  <p>Less than 24 hours before the booking</p>
  <p>Where a customer cancels less than 24 hours before the scheduled appointment, Opulence Bliss may apply a cancellation charge of up to 50% of the booking price.</p>
  <p>Any remaining balance will be refunded where applicable.</p>
  <p>Same-day cancellation or failure to attend</p>
  <p>Where a customer:</p>
  <p>Cancels on the day of the booking;</p>
  <p>Fails to provide access;</p>
  <p>Is unavailable when the cleaner arrives; or</p>
  <p>Prevents the cleaner from carrying out the agreed service,</p>
  <p>Opulence Bliss may charge up to 100% of the booking price.</p>
  <p>The actual charge will be considered in light of the circumstances.</p>
  <h2>4. Rescheduling</h2>
  <p>Customers are encouraged to reschedule rather than cancel where possible.</p>
  <p>Requests to reschedule should be made as early as possible.</p>
  <p>We will make reasonable efforts to accommodate the new date and time, subject to cleaner availability.</p>
  <p>Where a customer provides sufficient notice, we will normally try to reschedule the booking without a cancellation charge.</p>
  <p>Repeated changes or very late requests may be treated as cancellations.</p>
  <h2>5. Cleaner Cancellation</h2>
  <p>We understand that unexpected circumstances can affect a cleaner's ability to attend a booking.</p>
  <p>Where a cleaner cannot attend, they must notify Opulence Bliss as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
  <p>Examples of circumstances that may justify a cancellation include:</p>
  <p>Sudden illness;</p>
  <p>Emergency;</p>
  <p>Accident;</p>
  <p>Severe travel disruption;</p>
  <p>Unsafe working conditions;</p>
  <p>Family emergency; or</p>
  <p>Other circumstances beyond the cleaner's reasonable control.</p>
  <p>Where a cleaner cancels, Opulence Bliss will make reasonable efforts to:</p>
  <p>Find another suitable cleaner;</p>
  <p>Reschedule the booking; or</p>
  <p>Provide an appropriate refund where the service cannot be provided.</p>
  <p>Customers will not be charged a cancellation fee because a cleaner has cancelled.</p>
  <h2>6. Opulence Bliss Cancellation</h2>
  <p>In exceptional circumstances, Opulence Bliss may need to cancel a booking.</p>
  <p>Where we cancel a booking before the service has been provided, customers will normally receive either:</p>
  <p>An alternative booking date;</p>
  <p>An alternative cleaner; or</p>
  <p>A refund for the affected service.</p>
  <p>We will communicate the available options as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
  <h2>7. Customer Access Failure</h2>
  <p>Customers are responsible for ensuring that the cleaner can access the property at the agreed time.</p>
  <p>If a cleaner arrives at the agreed location but cannot gain access because:</p>
  <p>Nobody is present;</p>
  <p>Keys do not work;</p>
  <p>The key-safe code is incorrect;</p>
  <p>Access instructions are incorrect; or</p>
  <p>Another issue prevents entry,</p>
  <p>the booking may be treated as a customer cancellation or failed appointment.</p>
  <p>Where appropriate, the cleaner may be asked to wait for a reasonable period.</p>
  <p>If access cannot be provided within that period, a cancellation charge may apply.</p>
  <h2>8. Refunds</h2>
  <p>Where a refund is approved, Opulence Bliss will normally return the applicable amount to the original payment method where reasonably possible.</p>
  <p>Because we currently accept payment by bank transfer, refunds will normally be made by bank transfer.</p>
  <p>Customers may be asked to provide the bank details required to process the refund.</p>
  <p>Customers should not send bank details by unsecured or inappropriate means.</p>
  <h2>9. Cleaning Quality and Refund Requests</h2>
  <p>A customer should not automatically cancel a booking or request a full refund because they are dissatisfied with part of the cleaning service.</p>
  <p>Where there is an issue with the service, customers should contact us as soon as possible.</p>
  <p>We may ask for:</p>
  <p>Photographs;</p>
  <p>Details of the areas affected;</p>
  <p>The booking information; and</p>
  <p>Any other information reasonably required to investigate the matter.</p>
  <p>Depending on the circumstances, we may offer:</p>
  <p>A correction or re-clean;</p>
  <p>A partial refund;</p>
  <p>A full refund; or</p>
  <p>Another reasonable solution.</p>
  <p>The appropriate remedy will depend on the individual circumstances.</p>
  <h2>10. No Refund for Unused Time</h2>
  <p>Where a customer has booked a fixed amount of cleaning time, the cleaner will work within that agreed period.</p>
  <p>A customer generally will not be entitled to a refund simply because the cleaner completes the agreed cleaning tasks before the full booked period has elapsed.</p>
  <p>Similarly, where the customer requests additional work during the appointment, additional time or charges may apply.</p>
  <h2>11. Additional Cleaning Requests</h2>
  <p>If a customer requests additional services that were not included in the original booking, the cleaner should confirm with the customer and, where necessary, Opulence Bliss before additional charges are incurred.</p>
  <p>Additional services may include:</p>
  <p>Oven cleaning;</p>
  <p>Fridge cleaning;</p>
  <p>Interior window cleaning;</p>
  <p>Cabinet cleaning;</p>
  <p>Ironing;</p>
  <p>Laundry;</p>
  <p>Other specialist or additional cleaning.</p>
  <h2>12. Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
  <p>We understand that circumstances may arise that make it unreasonable to apply a standard cancellation charge.</p>
  <p>Examples may include:</p>
  <p>Serious illness;</p>
  <p>Bereavement;</p>
  <p>Emergency hospitalisation;</p>
  <p>Major property damage;</p>
  <p>Fire;</p>
  <p>Flood;</p>
  <p>Serious security incident;</p>
  <p>Other exceptional circumstances.</p>
  <p>Opulence Bliss may exercise reasonable discretion in such cases.</p>
  <p>Any decision will be considered on an individual basis.</p>
  <h2>13. Refund Processing Time</h2>
  <p>Once a refund has been approved, Opulence Bliss will aim to process it as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
  <p>The time taken for funds to appear in the customer's account may depend on the banking system and the customer's bank.</p>
  <h2>14. Disputing a Cancellation Charge</h2>
  <p>If you believe a cancellation charge has been applied incorrectly, please contact us.</p>
  <p>Please provide:</p>
  <p>Your name;</p>
  <p>Booking details;</p>
  <p>Date of cancellation;</p>
  <p>Reason for cancellation; and</p>
  <p>Any supporting information.</p>
  <p>We will review the circumstances and respond fairly.</p>
  <h2>15. Fairness to Customers and Cleaners</h2>
  <p>Our cancellation policy exists to protect both sides of the booking.</p>
  <p>When a customer cancels at short notice, the cleaner may have:</p>
  <p>Travelled to the property;</p>
  <p>Turned down another booking;</p>
  <p>Reserved the time exclusively for the customer; or</p>
  <p>Incurred travel or other expenses.</p>
  <p>At the same time, we recognise that customers may sometimes experience genuine emergencies.</p>
  <p>Our approach is therefore based on reasonable notice, fairness and individual circumstances.</p>
  <h2>16. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Cancellation &amp; Refund Policy from time to time.</p>
  <p>The latest version will be made available to customers through our website or booking process.</p>
  <p>Any material changes will be communicated where reasonably necessary.</p>
